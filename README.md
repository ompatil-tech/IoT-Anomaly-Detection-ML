Real-Time Anomaly Detection in IoT NetworksThis repository contains the implementation of the Machine Learning framework described in the paper: "Real-Time Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks: Building ML Models to Identify Anomalies in IoT Device Behavior".Project OverviewThe rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities. This project implements a real-time anomaly detection system capable of identifying irregular device behavior (e.g., cyberattacks or malfunctions) using a hybrid Machine Learning approach.Key MethodologiesPreprocessing: Data cleaning and dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).Unsupervised Learning: Isolation Forest for detecting novel anomalies without labeled training data.Deep Learning: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing time-series dependencies in sensor data.Dataset & ReproducibilityNote: By default, this script generates synthetic time-series data to demonstrate the pipeline without requiring external downloads.To reproduce the exact results cited in the publication (F1-score: 0.92), the models must be trained on the full UNSW-NB15 dataset.Synthetic Data (Demo): Expected F1-score ~0.90 - 1.00 (varies by random seed).Paper Results (Real Data): F1-score 0.92.RequirementsTo run this code, you will need the following Python libraries:pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
UsageRun the main detection script:python iot_anomaly_detection.py
